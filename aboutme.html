<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello, I'm Thomas Donofri. I am a Senior at [REDACTED]. My trade is Mechanical Design and Engineering Technology.  I am very passionate about my work, and I strive to empower my work to exceed everyone's expectations. My goal is to become a Game Designer at Sledgehammer Games. My biggest passion is video games, not just playing them, but understanding and manipulating how they function and play. I have created large-scale modifications for the 2003 video game The Simpsons: Hit & Run  . These modifications have playthrough videos uploaded to YouTube, and these videos typically have thousands of views. One mod in particular, Wiggum In Zombieland, has a video on YouTube that has exceeded 100,000 views! I am taking a year off after I graduate high school so I can properly decide on what college I intend to attend, and how I'm going to repay my debt after I graduate college. Ultimately I want to design and be a part of developing one of the biggest video game franchises currently, Call Of Duty.</p>
